## Presentation

This project is a sandbox project to learn Node.js development. We have two main goals :

-   learn how to create an API with Node.js and Express
-   follow a solid Github workflow

## Technical choices

### Sequelize

We choose to use the most use ORM for Node.js : [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/). This choice was motivated by our low technical level on Node.js environment and by the huge community arround the library.

### Deployment

Our pre-prod and prod API are host on Heroku. Deployments were greatly ease by the team great knowledge with this host.

We use the official [Heroku Postgres](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) addon the create our databases.
